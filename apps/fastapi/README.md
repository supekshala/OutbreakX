# 🚀 FastAPI Backend

This project provides the core API layer, built with FastAPI for high performance. It was migrated from a previous Node.js backend and is designed to integrate smoothly with outbreakx frontend.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**: Check your version with `python3 --version` or `python --version`. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd backend-fastapi
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:
    * It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies separately.
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment (using 'venv' folder name is common)
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    * Activate it:
        * **macOS / Linux**:
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        * **Windows (PowerShell)**:
            ```powershell
            .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
            # If script execution is disabled, you might need:
            # Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
            # then run the activation script again.
            ```
        * **Windows (CMD)**:
            ```cmd
            venv\Scripts\activate.bat
            ```
    * *(Your terminal prompt should now indicate that you are in the virtual environment, e.g., `(venv) ...`)*

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    * Create a `.env` file in the project root (`backend-fastapi/`).
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if provided) or add the necessary variables (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) section below).
    * Example `.env` content:
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
        # Add other variables as needed
        ```
    * **Important**: Ensure `.env` and `venv/` are listed in your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing secrets and the environment folder.

## ▶️ Running the Development Server

Once the setup is complete, run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

-   `main:app`: Tells Uvicorn where to find the FastAPI application instance (`app`) located in the `main.py` file inside the `app` directory.
-   `--reload`: Automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected. Ideal for development.
-   `--host 0.0.0.0`: Makes the server accessible on your local network (not just `localhost`).
-   `--port 8000`: Specifies the port to run on.

You should be able to access the API at `http://localhost:8000` or `http://<your-local-ip>:8000`.

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

The application requires certain environment variables to be set. These should be defined in a `.env` file in the project root.

| Variable       | Description                                   | Example                                           | Required |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Connection string for the database.           | `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`     | Yes      |


*(Add/remove variables as needed for your specific project)*

## 📦 Core Dependencies

This project relies on several key Python libraries:

-   [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): The core web framework.
-   [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/): The ASGI server to run the application.
-   [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/): Used for data validation and settings management.
-   [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/): The ORM for database interaction (if applicable).
-   [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): For loading environment variables from the `.env` file.
-   *(Add any other crucial dependencies, e.g., database drivers like `psycopg2-binary` for PostgreSQL)*

Refer to `requirements.txt` for the full, pinned list of dependencies.

---

## 📚 API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation. Once the development server is running, you can access:

-   **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
-   **ReDoc**: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

---

## 🧪 Testing

*(This section needs to be filled in based on your testing strategy)*

To run the tests:

```bash
# Example using pytest
pytest tests/
```

-   Describe the testing framework used (e.g., `pytest`).
-   Explain how to configure the test environment (e.g., test database).
-   Mention any specific commands or coverage reporting.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

*(This section needs to be filled in based on your deployment strategy)*

Provide instructions or notes on how to deploy the application. Examples:

-   **Docker**: Include steps to build and run the Docker image. Mention the `Dockerfile`.
-   **Serverless**: Instructions for deploying to platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, etc.
-   **Traditional Server**: Steps for setting up Uvicorn with Gunicorn behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.
